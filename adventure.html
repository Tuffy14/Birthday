        Your goal is to collect as many hearts as possible before time runs out or you miss 3 hearts. Use the arrow keys or touch controls to move the basket and catch the falling hearts. Are you ready?

            You know those hearts you’ve been collecting?  
            They weren’t just random points or game stuff — they were little pieces of appreciation from strangers whose days you unknowingly brightened.  
            That one time you smiled at someone who felt invisible, or sent a funny message when someone needed a laugh — it all mattered more than you think.  
            
            I still remember all our weird late-night talks, the inside jokes that make zero sense, and how you always seem to notice when something’s off.  
            Life’s just better with you in it.  
            
            I hope today brings all your favorite things — good food, silly surprises, and people who remind you how loved you are.  
            You deserve every bit of it, and more.
